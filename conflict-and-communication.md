# Communication Plan

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
```
We will primarily use the #mystechal-divinators Slack group to communicate. 

We discuss our evening plans before 6pm each day.

We prefer to organize periods of time where we can all work together in a Zoom room.  
```
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
```
We will prioritize daily emotional check-ins and stand-ups to asssess where we're each at with our claimed tasks, how we're feeling more generally about our team, and how we're feeling about the progress we're each making on our shared project. 

We care about listening to each other, even when someone communicates gently and/or quietly. We'll make sure that everyone is in agreement and has their voice heard at each step. 
```

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
```
All of the above. 

Allowing vulnerability. Caring about the experience of others. Making intentional space for sharing. 
```

# Conflict Plan

What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
```
We will use non-violent communication: I-statements, no name-calling or character accusation. Bring up specific actions and center how _you_ are affected by them. 

At the base of this, we will trust that everyone is united in our goal, and that everyone cares about conflict resolution with an end goal of bringing us closer.
```

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
```
If these concerns are not addressed during our group check-ins and stand-ups, we each feel comfortable asking for a one-on-one. If you're not comfortable with a one-on-one, you're welcome to ask any other teammate for help with a gentle call-in. 

We have a preference for these call-in conversations happening over video rather than phone or email. 
```

What is your process to resolve conflicts?
```
All of the above. We will attempt to resolve conflict within the circle first, and reach out for help if it cannot be resolved within. 
```

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
```
We imagine this happening only in the circumstance that one person is not invested in our shared goal, and we will reach out if conflict gets in the way of productivity.
